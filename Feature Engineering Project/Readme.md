# Uber and Lyft Dataset Boston, MA - Feature Engineering

This project is a part of the 1000ML Engineer Initiative and aims to analyze the Uber and Lyft Dataset Boston, MA dataset. The project utilizes feature engineering techniques to create new features from the raw data, which can help in building a better machine learning model for predicting ride demand.

## About Dataset

Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. So what exactly drives this demand? The first guess would be the time of the day; times around 9 am and 5 pm should see the highest surges on account of people commuting to work/home. Another guess would be the weather; rain/snow should cause more people to take rides.

NOTE: The date is for simulated rides with real prices i.e. how much would the ride cost IF someone actually took it. Uber/Lyft DO NOT make this data public and nor is the case in this dataset
